{"name":"Jumpstart v2","tagline":"Version 2 of a quick start template for sites, apps and prototypes - based on the Yeoman Gulp Webapp Generator with added Jade templating.","body":"This scaffolding is based on Yeoman - install all the usual dependencies to get that running on your system, then do `npm install` and `bower install` to get the site's local dependencies and tooling installed. Once that is done you can `gulp serve` to spin up the development server with live-reload and `gulp` to build for distribution.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nI should really remove the references to Bootstrap from the bare-bones setup herein, it's a vestige of the scaffolding's first usage.\r\n\r\nAlso it's probably worth including a thinner set of feature-detection and JS bootstrapping that that offered out of the box by Modernizr.\r\n\r\nLower priority is the inclusion of a basic set of modules and design patterns for JS development and a bundle of utility functions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
